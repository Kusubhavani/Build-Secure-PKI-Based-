PKI-2FA — RSA + TOTP Two-Factor Authentication Microservice

Project: PKI-Based 2FA Microservice 
Port: 8080 (HTTP)

Project Summary
This repository implements a secure, containerized microservice that demonstrates enterprise-grade security practices for two-factor authentication using:

RSA-4096 (OAEP-SHA256) for encrypted seed transport
RSA-PSS (SHA-256) for commit signatures
TOTP (SHA-1, 30s period, 6 digits) for 2FA generation/verification
Cron job to log TOTP codes every minute
Docker multi-stage build and docker-compose for easy deployment
Persistent volumes for /data (seed) and /cron (cron logs)
The project satisfies the assignment requirements: decrypting an instructor-provided encrypted seed, generating/verifying TOTP codes from the decrypted seed, cron logging, and providing cryptographic proof of work.
